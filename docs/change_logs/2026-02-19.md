## Summary
Fixed React Server Component (RSC) errors in multiple pages where the `Link` component was being passed as a prop to MUI `Button` components.

## Changes
- **Privacy Policy Page**:
    - Added `'use client';` directive to `src/app/(main)/privacy-policy/page.tsx` to allow passing the `NextLink` function to the MUI `Button` component.
- **Welcome Page**:
    - Added `'use client';` directive to `src/app/(marketing)/welcome/page.tsx` to allow passing the `Link` function to the MUI `Button` component.
- **Comparison Table Section**:
    - Implemented a new premium `ComparisonTable` component (`comparison-table.tsx`) with detailed competitor analysis and Zen Analytics USP highlights.
    - Simplified the previous `Comparison` component and integrated the new table into the main landing page between `Hero` and `Features`.
    - Optimized the table for SEO/GEO based on strategic research material.

## Impact
- **Small/Medium**: Fixes build/runtime errors and adds a major feature to the landing page.
- **Low Risk**: Standard component implementation and integration.
