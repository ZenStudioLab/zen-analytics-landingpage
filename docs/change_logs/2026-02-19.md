## Summary
Fixed a React Server Component (RSC) error in the Privacy Policy page where the `NextLink` component was being passed as a prop to a MUI `Button`.

## Changes
- **Privacy Policy Page**:
    - Added `'use client';` directive to `src/app/(main)/privacy-policy/page.tsx` to allow passing the `NextLink` function to the MUI `Button` component.

## Impact
- **Small**: Fixes a runtime error that prevented the Privacy Policy page from rendering.
- **Low Risk**: Standard procedure for MUI components requiring client-side props in Next.js App Router.
