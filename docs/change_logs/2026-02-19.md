## Summary
Fixed React Server Component (RSC) errors in multiple pages where the `Link` component was being passed as a prop to MUI `Button` components.

## Changes
- **Privacy Policy Page**:
    - Added `'use client';` directive to `src/app/(main)/privacy-policy/page.tsx` to allow passing the `NextLink` function to the MUI `Button` component.
- **Welcome Page**:
    - Added `'use client';` directive to `src/app/(marketing)/welcome/page.tsx` to allow passing the `Link` function to the MUI `Button` component.

## Impact
- **Small**: Fixes build and runtime errors that prevented these pages from rendering/prerendering.
- **Low Risk**: Standard procedure for MUI components requiring client-side props in Next.js App Router.
